## Description

The website uses external api to show news articles in a tabular format.

## Getting Started
I have used xampp for the development of the webpage. Xampp could be installed from 
```
https://www.apachefriends.org/
```

Go to the location where xampp is installed and locate directory named 'htdocs'.

• Create a new directory named 'webapp' inside of 'htdocs'. <br/>
• Clone the repo.<br/>
• Start xampp apache server. <br/>
• Go to the web browser and in the address bar write 'localhost/webapp'. <br/>
